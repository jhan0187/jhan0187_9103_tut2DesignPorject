**Jianan's Individual work- Animation of Perlin Noise**
Draw the movement of the people on the bridge and a flash\

I use the random value in the noise function and adds them to each part of the person’s body. For instance, “head”, “body”, “hat”, and “arms” of Person1 and Person2. In addition, Person1 and Person2’s feet have larger xOffest. Since I want “shoe”
to move faster and mimic the real movement when people walk. Furthermore, I draw a flash between the background and the people on the bridge. Whenever the flash changes, people also jump as the flash moves.
